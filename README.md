# XSS-ctf
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
This repository highlights my work on identifying and mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. XSS is a type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign websites, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of users. The project includes examples of XSS attacks, how they are exploited, and best practices for securing applications against these vulnerabilities.
